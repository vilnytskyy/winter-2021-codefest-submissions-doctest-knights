The DegreeWorks+ layout is reminiscent of DegreeWorks. The course schedule brings a hint of CUNYfirst to DegreeWorks+.

Every requirement’s status stands out in vivid colors. Courses you’ve taken, are currently taking, or need to take stand out too.

-   Education

Please incorporate it into your project, and we hope to see new, exciting, and innovative projects!
